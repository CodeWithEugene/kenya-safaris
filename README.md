## The Problem

Kenya is one of the world’s most iconic safari destinations, yet its domestic tours and travel sector remains fragmented and under-discovered:

- **Thousands of small to mid-sized tour operators** offer incredible, affordable experiences—but have no visibility beyond WhatsApp groups, Instagram pages, or word-of-mouth.
- **Travelers (especially domestic and diaspora)** are forced to manually search, DM random pages, or rely on referrals to plan trips.
- **No centralized platform** exists to discover, compare, and book these hidden gems—despite demand for curated, trusted safari and travel experiences.

> **In short:** Kenya has the safari magic, but it’s scattered across unindexed channels.

---

## Our Solution

**SafariLink** is a digital marketplace connecting travelers with Kenya’s rich but underexposed tours and experiences.  
_Think of it as the “Airbnb for local tour operators.”_

## Why Now?

- **Rising domestic travel:** Kenyans are traveling more, especially young people and groups. But discovery is hard.
- **Digital maturity:** SMEs are ready to digitize but lack tools or support.
- **Diaspora and international travelers** want easy, secure, verified ways to book local experiences.
- **Safari travel is no longer seasonal:** There is growing demand for weekend getaways, cultural tours, camping, and wellness retreats all year round.

---

## Technology

SafariLink leverages **Avalanche blockchain** to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof booking records.  
By utilizing Avalanche, we provide verifiable transaction history for both travelers and operators, building trust and reducing fraud in the marketplace.

---

## Revenue Streams

- **Commission Model (10–20%)** on each successful booking.
- **Subscription Plans** for premium operators (priority listing, analytics, booking tools).
- **Featured Listings & Ads:** Tour companies pay for top placements on homepage or region-specific searches.
- **Affiliate Partnerships:** Collaborate with hotels, car hire companies, and activity organizers.
- **White-labeled Booking Tools:** For tour companies to integrate on their own websites or IG bios.
- **Data Analytics & Insights:** Sell aggregated insights on domestic tourism trends to stakeholders and the Ministry of Tourism.
- **Event and Group Travel Deals:** Curate group safaris and earn from bulk bookings (especially during holiday seasons).

---

## 🚀 Traction & Vision

- **A digital backbone** for digitizing thousands of tour companies across Kenya.
- **A data-rich source of truth** for travel trends, pricing, and behavior across the region.
